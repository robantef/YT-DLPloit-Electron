# Icon files needed for distribution

To complete the distribution setup, you need to add icon files:

## Required Icons:

- `assets/icon.png` - 512x512 PNG for Linux AppImage
- `assets/icon.ico` - ICO file for Windows installer
- `assets/icon.icns` - ICNS file for macOS DMG

## How to create icons:

1. Create a 512x512 PNG image of your app icon
2. Use online converters or tools like:
   - For ICO: https://convertio.co/png-ico/
   - For ICNS: https://convertio.co/png-icns/
3. Place them in the `assets/` folder

## Temporary placeholder:

For now, you can copy any PNG image as `icon.png` to test the build process.
